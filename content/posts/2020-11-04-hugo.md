To create a new site, run `hugo new site mysitename` in the terminal.

To create a new page, run `hugo new page.md` in the terminal. To create a new page within a diretory, run `hugo new dir/page.md`.

To run the site locally, run `hugo server` in the terminal. To build the site including draft pages, run `hugo server -D`.

Edit archetypes/default.md to change the default front matter generated. To set default front matter for specific diretories, create files in archetypes with the name of the directory.

To add html snippets (short code), type {{< youtube U-C0I-Ks14M >}}

To create a custom taxonomy, `moods`, in your config.toml create a new array listing all used taxononomies (including the default tags and categories). Put singular on the left and plural on the right:

``` yaml
[taxonomies]
  tag = "tag"
  category = "categories"
  mood = "moods"
```

Push files (not including the public directory) to username.github.io

Include a yaml file

``` yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout master
      uses: actions/checkout@v1
      with:
        submodules: true

    - name: Hugo Deploy GitHub Pages
      uses: benmatselby/hugo-deploy-gh-pages@master
      env:
        HUGO_VERSION: 0.68.3
        TARGET_REPO: soniamitchell/soniamitchell.github.io
        TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HUGO_TOKEN }}
        CNAME: sonia-mitchell.com
```

where TARGET_REPO points at your username.github.io repository

Go to settings and put your custom domain in custom domain. This will create a CNAME file. Copy the contents of this file into the CNAME field in the build.yaml.
